## Pre-Colonialization.

**Grenada early Inhabitants:** People of South America were exploring the southern Caribbean islands hundreds of years before the arrival of the Europeans. The Kalinago inhabited Grenada when Columbus sited and named the island Conception in 1498 on his third visit to the new world. The Spanish never settled Grenada but used it as a refueling stop on their way to and from Trinidad and South America.

Due to their oral tradition, there is little recorded history about the indigenous inhabitants of Grenada before their genocide. Archaeologist has discovered burial ground and artifacts such as pottery, clay figures, musical instruments, jewelry, tools, beads and petroglyph on more than 87 sites where indigenous people lived in Grenada. Some larger sites were found on the northeast coastline at Pearls and La Poterie.

Ivan Van Sertima wrote extensively in his book They came before Columbus about the Mandingo presence pre-Columbus. He wrote Mansa Abu Bakr II as Emperor of the Mandinka kingdom of Mali West Africa. He financed and was part of a marine exploration mission in search of a new world across the ocean to the west of Africa in 1310 to 1311. Van Sertima also wrote of contact between indigenous Americans and the Songhai empire of West Africa in 1462 to 1492. The European enslavement of Africans in the Americas began in 1506. Pope Martin's decree allowed Bartholomew De Las Casas to transport the first African to Hispaniola from Spain.

**Africans presence before Columbus:** Garinagos also known as the Black Caribs of Saint Vincent lived on the northeast coast of Saint Vincent. Today the Garifuna people who live throughout Central America, maintain that they were part of a marine expedition led by Mansa Abu Bakr II Emperor of the Mandinka kingdom. The English author William Young wrote that the Garifuna people were Africans who were shipwrecked onboard a Spanish slave ship in the early 1600s. The Africans were rescued by the Kalinago who temporally enslaved them, upon gaining their freedom they married Kalinago and adopted their language, culture. The Black Caribs seeking their autonomy relocated to the island's densely forested northeast.

Garinago and Kalinago resistance to the colonization of Saint Vincent and Dominica caused the islands to be declared neutral by the French and British until the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Due to the genocidal nature of European colonization Saint Vincent and Dominica became safe havens for the Indigenous people and African slaves from the other southern Caribbean islands.

The Black Caribs allied with the French to fight against the British in the Black Carib Wars which ended in 1779. They also traded with the French for muskets, gunpowder and balls as far north a Guadalupe. They were led by Joseph Chotoyer who died in a battle the same year 1797. The lost of their leader and starvation due to the burning of their houses and crops brought about their surrender. They were rounded up and exiled to Roatan an island off the east coast of Honduras by the British on the 5th April 1797. The Garifuna people and their culture can still be found today throughout Honduras, Guatemala and Belize. Joseph Chatoyer is celebrated on 14 March as the first national hero in Saint Vincent.

**Grenada history teaches:** France was the first European to colonize Grenada only after breaking Carib resistance. The northern parish of Sauteurs has its name because the last Caribs committed suicide by throwing themselves over a cliff at Leaper's hill. The 1950 Grenada census shows that people identified as Caribs. Today people identify as Kalinagos on the island of Dominica. It is possible to compare both people and prove that the Caribs are Africans who inhabited the southern Caribbean before the European invasion.

The first attempt to settle Grenada by Europeans was in June 1609, when an English expedition arrived aboard the Diana, Penelope, and Endeavour. The settlement was attacked and destroyed by the natives, who tortured and killed many of the settlers. The ships returned on 15th December 1609, forcing the few survivors to leave the island.

## French arrival

**Settler Colonization:** The island was settled as a French proprietary colony in 1649 and named La Grenade. By 1655 the indigenous population was almost completely wiped out due to wars and European diseases. According to French history the last of the Caribs jumped to their death at mount de Sautes now called Leapers Hill. It is known that the victors writes the history and Napoleon once said that history is a fable agreed upon. It is a fact that the Garifuna people also known as the Black Caribs a mixture of Africans and Kalinago lived on Saint Vincent the next large island north of Grenada.

The Black Caribs were known to be mariners, who traded with the surrounding islands. At the time Saint Vincent and Dominica were neutral islands to the French and British because of the strong resistance to European colonization. Both islands were also known as a safe haven for Indigenous people and runaway African slaves from the other islands escaping European slavery and colonization.

During French colonization Grenada remained sparsely populated and economically underdeveloped compared to France’s other Caribbean colonies such as Haiti and Martinique. They were the first to transport Africans to the island as slaved to clear the land and work on their plantations. The first cash crop the French planted was tobacco then coffee and cocoa which were not very labour intensive. Later as the enslaved African work force grew, they planted indigo and sugar cane. They also planted sweet potatoes, plantains and other crops mainly for local consumption.

**French Rule:** The island was mainly locally governed this afforded the free coloured certain privileges. They were allowed to marry, practice Catholicism, join the militia and own land. The enslaved Africans skillfully negotiated a few privileges from the French. These privileges were used as soft power to appease the Africans and guarantee a peaceful coexistence for the French. The Code Noir stipulations mandated Africans to be baptized into Roman Catholicism which then allowed interracial marriages of white French men to free Africans women with the outcome of biracial children. The biracial children were then allowed to marry each other to create the Mulatto or young mule in Spanish and Portuguese.

Africans maintained the essence of their native beliefs by adapting their spiritual practices and beliefs to a Christian frame of reference. The enslaved African used for example the Roman Catholic All Saints and All Souls to mask the reverence to their ancestors because it was disallowed by the French enslavers. The Africans lit fires and brought food and drink to the burial sites of their ancestors on these days. The practice is carried out today on All Saints and All Souls with a party atmosphere and the lighting of candles at the island's larger cemeteries.

In 1671 Grenada was home to 283 free colonists and 222 slaves, by the end of the Seven Years’ War in 1763, Grenada counted 646 free families and approximately 13,000 slaves. France invaded Grenada and ruled the island for the second time from 1779 to 1783. This brings to mind 200 years later 1979 to 1983.

## Neo Colonization.

**Fake self determination, Revolution, Neo Liberalism:** Independence Day 7.2.1974 started at midnight on Fort George as the Union Jack was lowered and the new Grenada flag was hoisted. Grenada now has a flag, a national anthem, a local government and British Crown representative as a Governor General. Sir Eric Mathew Gairy as the leader of the Grenada United Labour Party became the new Prime Minister.

**Independence and Revolution:**
The culmination of these social, economic, and political factors was Grenada's independence from Britain in 1974, followed by the revolution in 1979. The New Jewel Movement, led by Maurice Bishop, promised social reforms, economic development, and greater political freedom. The revolution was initially popular, as it addressed many of the grievances that had built up over decades of colonial rule and Gairy's dictatorship.

## Peoples Revolutionary Government.

**Grenada Revolution** started on the 13th of March 1979 with the takeover of the island administration, this made Grenada the only English-speaking country in the 20th century to successfully depose British rule. The New Jewel Movement became the People Revolutionary Government led by Maurice Bishop a young and charismatic lawyer. Geopolitics turned Grenada into a pariah state because the government was not democratically elected and would not re-instate the elected government.

Cuba became one of the first allies of the Maurice Bishop government which brought Grenada in direct conflict with the United States. Fidel Castro and the Cuban people extended the hand of friendship and assistance in the development of the people and the country. In a short span of time Grenada showed substantial growth not only in its economy but also in its human resources for example by improving the literacy rate, students were given scholarships to study abroad. Agriculture and Infra-structure development became the main focus of the People Revolutionary Government.

Institutions such as The National Insurance Scheme, Nation Cooperation Banking, The Nation Marketing and Importing Board, has their genesis from the P.R.G. Agra-processing spurred Agriculture production and a manufacturing industry. This boost the local economy and trade in the form of export mainly barter. Tourism became the industry of the future and infra-structure like an International airport was necessary but unavailable locally.

Grenada embarked on a development drive with the support of the grass root in the communities with assistance from the people of Cuba and their President Fidel Castro. Groups were formed to organize the people in the implication of various programs. Women and juvenile groups were popular and carried out numerous function in the communities. Defence became a priority and a Defence force and a militia was organized to protect the country.

Within a short period industries were established or regenerated like Agriculture where the P.R.G. began obtaining indebted estates and establishing an Argo-processing plants, Construction of the International airport, Affordable housing, The health sector was improved with Cuban assistance, qualified students were sent on foreign scholarships. The nation started seeing improvement in living standards and a glimpse of prosperity.

Caribbean nations were now paying attention to Grenada development with some seeing the P.R.G. as an alternative to their form of government. The proximity to Cuba and by default Russia brought the island into the geopolitical focus of the Cold War which made it a threat to western hegemony and the Monroe Doctrine of the USA. A propaganda war began with rhetoric being the weapon of choice.

Counter revolution and destabilization brought on infighting within the P.R.G. government which culminated in the execution of Maurice Bishop along with nine members of his cabinet including a pregnant female on 19.10.1983 at Fort George in Grenada's capital. Hudson Philip as head of the P.R.A. or the People Revolutionary Army brought the country under military rule and ordered an island wide curfew.

On the 25.10.1983 the island awoke to the sound of aircraft and bombs. American troops with the help of 6 Caribbean nation invaded Grenada. Urgent Fury lasted till 2.11.1983 and the US left by mid-December 1983 leaving noncombat troops as advisors on the island.

## Neo Liberalism.

**Post Revolution** meant eliminating all that the P.R.G. period produced except the airport Construction and some Institutions formed by the Revolutionary Government. All other traces of the Revolution was destroyed even the body of the Revolutionary Prime minister Maurice Bishop has not been found to the present day. The period began with a transitional phase led by Sir Paul Scoon as Governor General before election was held.

Prime Minister Margret Thatcher of England and President Ronald Reagan of the US introduced a new economically system where wealth would be transferred from the Public into Private ownership. This is the birth of Neo Liberalism which is to become the model of government to be practiced in England and the English-speaking world. Grenada as a transitioning nation became an ideal candidate for this experiment.

NNP or New National Party led by Herbert Blaize won the first post P.R.G. election and formed the new government. The island regained political stability and constitutional rule and ushered in the Neo Liberal agenda attempting to rebuild the economy promoting agriculture and tourism as the main focus.

The changing political landscape and the death of Herbert Blaize in 1989 saw the N.D.C. Nation Democratic Congress winning the 1990 election and Nicolas Brathwaite becoming the Prime Minister and was succeeded by George Brizan. After the events of the 80s Grenada sought reconstruction also reconciliation seeking economic recovery and re-engagement with international institutions.

Doctor Keith Mitchell became the leader of the N.N.P. and Prime minister when N.N.P. won the 1995 election and held government until 2008. N.D.C. under Tilman Thomas leadership won the election that year, but the party imploded and saw NNP being returned to government winning every seat in the election. Dr.Mitchell would form the government as Prime minister until 2022. At present Hon.Decon Mitchell is one of the youngest Prime ministers in the world along with a very young parliament.

**Today Grenadians** are still seeking prosperity for all and showing the resilience of our ancestors who were kidnapped and transported to the Caribbean. Our ancestors had a slave life expectancy of possibly seven years but more than four centuries later we are still here and thriving.

As one of the smallest nations Grenada and its people have survived all major man made and natural disasters, from war with the US to categorical hurricanes. The island has built and rebuilt many times to arrive at the point we are today.
