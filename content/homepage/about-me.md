**African born on the Caribbean island of Grenada.**

"My deep love for the history of the African presence in the Americas, as well as for the flora and fauna of this island paradise we call Grenada, drives my work in planning and leading tours across the island. With years of experience in this area, I offer high-quality AfroCentric tours that match your interests and budget.

You can count on each excursion to provide a personalized and unique experience. Let's explore the natural beauty and rich culture of the Caribbeanâ€™s Spice Isle together.

Through **Private Afrocentric Tours Grenada**, I aim to inspire visitors and create unforgettable memories by focusing on the island's African heritage and sharing my knowledge of and passion for the island."
